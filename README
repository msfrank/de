A MAME emulator of epic proportions
-----------------------------------

1. Installation

 de requires python, pygtk, and bsddb3.  If you are running Ubuntu, the
 packages are python, python-gtk2, and python-bsddb3.

2. Configuration

 de first needs to build a database from the MAME supported games list.  To
 do this, first run the following command to get the list in xml format:

  $ mame -listxml > games.xml

 Then, generate the de database from the games list:

  $ de-resync games.xml

 This creates a file called games.db in the current directory.

3. Adding games

 Each game present in your library needs to be added using the de-add-game
 command:

  $ de-add-game <gamename>

4. Running the frontend

 After you have added your games, run the frontend:

  $ double-elbow

 The 'w' and 's' keys scroll up and down.  'enter' to start playing a game,
 'q' quits the frontend.
